2. REPORT DETAILS

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U1/NET3284 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U1/Qint[2]_i_2/O, cell U1/Qint[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U2/NET3292 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U2/Qint[2]_i_2__0/O, cell U2/Qint[2]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U3/NET3300 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U3/Qint[2]_i_2__1/O, cell U3/Qint[2]_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U5/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U5/Qint[1]_i_2/O, cell U5/Qint[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U7/Q_GREEN0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U7/Q_GREEN_reg_i_2/O, cell U7/Q_GREEN_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U7/Qint_reg[0]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U7/Q_RED_reg_i_2/O, cell U7/Q_RED_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT U1/Qint[2]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
U7/Qint_reg[0], U7/Qint_reg[1], U7/Qint_reg[2]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT U2/Qint[2]_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
U8/Qint_reg[0], U8/Qint_reg[1], U8/Qint_reg[2]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT U3/Qint[2]_i_2__1 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
U9/Qint_reg[0], U9/Qint_reg[1], U9/Qint_reg[2]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT U5/Qint[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
U6/Qint_reg[0], U6/Qint_reg[1]
Related violations: <none>
